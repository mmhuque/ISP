The demand for natural resources remains high, prompting the Oil and Gas industries to expand their drilling operations both onshore and offshore using advanced, sensor-laden tools. These sensors collect millions of data points in real time during drilling activities. This downhole drilling data is rich with critical insights about geological formations, drilling dynamics, and subterranean resources. Despite this, once drilling concludes, much of this data typically remains unanalyzed. A thorough analysis of downhole drilling data could reveal opportunities for enhancing drilling techniques, which could then be applied to future operations in similar geological formation.


For this analysis, we will utilize downhole drilling data from the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB). The C-NLOPB maintains a public data repository, accessible on their website (https://home-cnlopb.hub.arcgis.com/pages/well-inventory), which includes data on all drilling activities within their jurisdiction.
